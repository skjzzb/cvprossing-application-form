Since it is my first job after completing my education , I was very excited and embarrassed at the same time. During this Lockdown I got a call from Jai mam about a Technical interview , it started from there until now every person I came across in GSlab is supportive. Starting from the virtual joining process to Training sessions.Jai mam helped us a lot to know the culture and formalities at GSlab.It was my first Job experience and it started at home, so I faced very difficulties setting up the environment  on my machine to get compatible with softwares used here.It can not be done without IT team support.After that Anand sir guided us throughout training sessions ,these sessions are very helpful and well organised.Anand sir makes it way easier than I ever thought about it.Its been only a month and couple of days I joined this organisation, and i already feel as part of this family. Thank you!!
